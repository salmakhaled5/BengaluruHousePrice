# Real Estate Price Prediction Website - Data Science Project

This data science project series aims to build a real estate price prediction website. We'll construct a predictive model using scikit-learn and linear regression with the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com. Then, we'll create a Python Flask server for handling HTTP requests and design a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can input property features to get predicted prices. We'll cover data loading, cleaning, outlier detection, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, and k-fold cross-validation during model building.

## Project Components

1. **Data Exploration and Model Building**: In this phase, we will use Python along with libraries such as NumPy and Pandas to perform data cleaning and visualization. We will develop a predictive model using scikit-learn and linear regression to estimate real estate prices based on the dataset.

2. **Python Flask Server**: Building on the trained model, we will create a Python Flask server. The server will be responsible for handling HTTP requests and responding with predicted prices.

3. **Web Interface**: The website will be designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user interface. Users can input property details, such as square footage and number of bedrooms, which will be passed to the Python Flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
